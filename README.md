Project 3: Interactive Visualization using D3.js

Our project focused on creating an interactive visualization to explore internet usage data across various countries, regions, and continents over time. We selected a line chart as our primary visualization, as it effectively communicates trends and changes in usage over time, allowing users to observe and compare patterns easily. For color encoding, we implemented distinct colors for each country when the comparison mode is enabled, using D3’s color scheme to ensure visual clarity and contrast. The visualization's interactivity includes continent and country dropdown filters, a year range slider, and a comparison mode toggle. The dropdowns allow users to refine their view to specific continents and countries, while the year range slider lets users focus on particular timeframes. Enabling comparison mode differentiates each country’s line with distinct colors, making multi-country analysis straightforward and visually accessible. We considered using different line styles (e.g., dashed lines) in comparison mode but found color-based distinctions to be simpler and more intuitive for users.

The development process was a collaborative effort. We divided the work so that one team member focused on setting up the basic HTML structure and configuring D3 to load and render the line chart, while the other handled implementing the interactive elements, including the dropdown filters, year range slider, and comparison mode toggle. Together, we brainstormed and refined the visualization’s design and functionality, carefully considering different design choices before finalizing our approach. We worked together on testing and debugging to ensure the visualization was accessible, user-friendly, and functional across different browsers. This project allowed us to balance functionality with user experience, resulting in an engaging and informative tool for data exploration.

We spent roughly 5 hours developing the application, including setup, coding, and testing. The most time-intensive aspects were configuring the interactive elements, particularly the comparison mode and year range slider, as well as ensuring all filters worked seamlessly together across different user selections. Debugging and fine-tuning the interactions to create a smooth, intuitive user experience also required a significant portion of our time.
